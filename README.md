It runs.
It kinda works.
Some tests pass.
We seem to be able to do some json documents, sort of.
There is a front-end that will render a document on the screen
It has a form.

We need to make it a working form: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_elements.asp 
<label for="cars">Choose a car:</label>
<select id="cars" name="cars" size="4" multiple>
  <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
  <option value="saab">Saab</option>
  <option value="fiat">Fiat</option>
  <option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select>
