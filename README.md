# Quizzology

It runs.

Currently Quizzology is a slow-coding target. We work on it a very little bit at a time, and constantly refer to the
charter. We didn't choose a nice fancy architecture, no CSS, no nice HTML5, no client-side javascript wizardry.

The purpose of this project is not so much to make a project, but to intentionally and carefully practice TDD,
refactoring, evolutionary design, and minimalism.

Don't look at it as a finished product, but a starting point for doing fun stuff.

In the works:

* Create a CI pipeline
* Create a cloud deploy
* Create some kind of identity so our results and other people's results aren't all mixed together
* Remember past sessions, so we can re-quiz on quizzes and questions from past
* Keep track of questions that we've missed most, and refresh on those
* Make it look less awful
